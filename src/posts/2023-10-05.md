# Clean Slate

<time>7:25am</time>

Dear Reader,

&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morning! I feel a bit better. I got up at a quarter to three, walked Dawa, plucked for a couple hours, got myself together, and went to Dunkin Donuts in that cute gray (and very practical) dress Elsbeth gave me. I got my hair looking okay and posted a picture of myself in a black cami and jeans with the caption, "I'm not your toy, I'm not your play-thing, I'm a goddamn human being living my life, and I'm going to look goddamn good doing it."

&nbsp;&nbsp;And _now_ I'm going to work on the website.
